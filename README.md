# PricePerCubicMetre

Is it possible to compare the prices of all things in a way that is universally standardized so that meaningful comparisons can be made?

When prices of commodities such as gas (gasoline/petrol) increase, we take notice and stories about it will make headlines in the news. There's a momentary feeling of outrage, but then we go about our day. We may buy other things, but we rarely put their prices into the context as with gas. For instance, when you fill up your car with gas, you might ticked-off that the price went up from $1.49 per litre to $1.59 per litre, but when you go in to pay, you also buy a 473ml bottle of water for $3.49 and be totally OK with that price. You just paid $7.38 per litre for the bottled water, but it was the price of gas you were unhappy about.

 Why is this? I'd argue that these products are actually sold in completely different ways. Gas and many other commodities are sold in a relatively simple way, it's a price for a specified volume or weight. Other products, like bottled water are sold by the bottle of case. Sure, the size is printed on the bottle, but that is only because the government forces manufacturers to do so. Sure, it's fairly easy to do the math in this example if you live a place like Canada where we use the Metric System. Take the same example, but in America where gas is sold in gallons and bottled water in ounces. How easy is that price comparison? 

The prices of other commodities are also set in relatively simple ways. Take the price of gold for example, it's about $2,700 per ounce. We all know that gold is far more expensive than bottled water or gas, but how much more expensive it is? This is not a simple question because "ounces" of water refer to a measure of volume (fluid ounces) and of "ounces" gold refer to a unit of mass. To make things even more complicated gold is priced in troy ounces, not regular US ounces. A troy ounce is about 10% larger, 31.10 grams vs. 28.35 grams. This may be just a math problem, and the relative densities of gold and water can be used (or gas) to find the answer. However, what if you want to know the price of a gallon of gold?

If you're interested, the answer is about 5.7 million dollars (1.5 million per litre). By contrast, gas costs about 7 cents per troy ounce and bottled water 23 cents. Are these ridiculous comparisons? In some ways, the answer is "yes"... you're not going to the gas station to "fill 'er up" with 20 gallons gold, lol. However, knowing that bottled water is 5 times the price of gas is useful. Interestingly, gold is about a million times more expensive than gas, but only 200,000 times more expensive than bottled water.

To put the price of bottled water vs. gas in a more appropriate context one need only examine a utilities bill. I currently pay $1.59 per cubic metre, or 1,000 litres. This means that gas is 1,000 times more expensive than tap water, but bottled water is 5,000 times more expensive! The companies that bottle water actually pay far less than that, they effectively pay nothing.

Look at a table of the price of tap water, bottled water gas and gold:
gold is a billion times more expenisve than tap water

In this context things become more meaningful 


The goal of this project is to make price comparisons of many different commodities using a somewhat Minecraftesc approach, and standardizing on a single unit of measurement: price per cubic metre.
